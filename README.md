Queue [ Linked Lists ] in C++

A queue is a FIFO list (First In First Out queue). A simple example is waiting in line, where the first person in the line is the first served. New arrivals are added to the back of the line, the next person served is (removed) from the front of the line. Thus project is a Queue class that implements a queue abstraction.

Necessary skills: class construction, class composition, pointers and linked lists, heap memory management with C++ new/delete operators.
